Based on your answers, here's where you stand and how to level up:

Assessment Summary

✅ You understand:

== (comparison) vs = (assignment)

Default values of instance variables

Basics of HashMap vs TreeMap


❌ You need to improve:

.equals() vs == (Object comparison)

Static methods and instance variables

Array vs ArrayList vs LinkedList

Exception handling (finally block behavior)

Thread synchronization (synchronized, volatile)

Memory management (JVM internals, object allocation)

Serialization (transient keyword)
