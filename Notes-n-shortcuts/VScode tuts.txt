   - **GitLens**: Install this extension for advanced Git features like blame, history, and inline code annotations.

### 5. **Debugging**
   - **Breakpoints**: Set breakpoints by clicking in the gutter next to line numbers.
   - **Start Debugging**:
     - `F5` or use the **Run** panel to launch your application with a debugger.
     - **Debug Configuration**: VSCode auto-detects configurations for most languages, but you can manually configure by creating a `launch.json` in the `.vscode` folder.
   - **Watch Variables/Expressions**: Add variables or expressions to the Watch panel in the Debug side panel to monitor their values.
   - **Debug Console**: Use this to interact with your program while debugging, view logs, or print variable values.

   - **Multiple Terminals**: Open multiple terminal tabs by clicking the "+" button in the terminal panel.
   - **Run Commands**: Execute commands in your project directory directly from the terminal.
   - **Task Runner**: Configure and run tasks (like build scripts) using `tasks.json` in the `.vscode` folder.

### 7. **Workspaces**
   - **Folders**: Open a single folder with `File > Open Folder` or drag it into the editor.
   - **Workspaces**: Save your project’s settings and configurations for specific projects with a workspace file (`.code-workspace`).
   - **Multi-folder Workspaces**: You can add multiple folders to a single workspace (useful for microservices, monorepos, etc.).

### 8. **Customization**
   - **Settings**: VSCode settings are customizable through a GUI or by editing `settings.json`.
